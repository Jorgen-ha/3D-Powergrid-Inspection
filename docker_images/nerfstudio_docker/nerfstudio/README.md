# Standard Nerfstudio files
This directory is holding the necessary files to be able to use the Nerfstudio container image, and is a direct copy of the folder found in the [official repo](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/nerfstudio/tree/main/nerfstudio), with the exception that some files have been removed. 

All credit for the code inside this folder is given to the developers of Nerfstudio.
