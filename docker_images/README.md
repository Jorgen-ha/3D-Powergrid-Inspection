Several containers were used for this thesis project, and they can all be found in this directory. 

All of them are slight modifications of the original docker images provided by each software, as credited below. The modifications made relates to making the containers work on the available hardware of SINTEF's HPC.

In addition to the docker images, the scripts developed to use them are also provided in their respective folders.
